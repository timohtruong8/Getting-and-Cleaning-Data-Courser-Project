# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

> The Project is for Getting and Cleaning Data Course. The following are steps produced in R Studio for the R Script file 'run_analysis.R' to produce the submission file 'TidyData.txt'

> I have downloaded the data and then The R Script 'run_analysis.R' does the following:

1. Sets the project folder as the working directory and load the required packages
2. Reads the files given in the project and create them into table format
3. Merges the training and test sets into one data table
4. Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Uses descriptive names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately renames the variables in the data set
7. From the current data set, it creates a second and independent tidy data set for averages of each variable for activites and subjects.

> This creates the end result in 'TidyData.txt'
